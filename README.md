The purpose of this repository is to share YAML files for snap building by `snapcraft` program. Here you can find YAMLs for programs that disappeared from Ubuntu repositories because they are not compatible with versions of packages/libraries, for example programs made in Python 2. 

Snap is an easy way to use old programs that are using old versions of libraries. These libraries cannot be installed without conflicts, cause they are not compatible with current libraries or packages.

All snaps generated by these files will be uploaded to https://snapcraft.io/store

One exception: for now there's one AppImage recipe file. If there will be more in future I will create separate repo for them.
